Bang! 1.0
---------

Bang! is a Wild West-themed card game, designed by Emiliano Sciarra and released by Italian publisher daVinci Editrice in 2002.

This C++ implementation, developed by Matouš Skála as a semestral work in the course Programming and Algorithmics 2 at FIT CTU, is inspired by the original game rules, but it is a little bit simplified.

The architecture is based on a client–server model. When a user hosts a game, GameServer is started as a separate process on his computer. Then all the users (even the host himself) are connecting with GameClient to that server via TCP stream sockets. Each client keeps 2 opened connections – one for synchronous two-way communication (API) and the other one for game state change events from the server. The port on which server is running must be accessible by other players' computers.
